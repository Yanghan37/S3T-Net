The Depo-Net architecture employs two distinct yet complementary encoder paths: the RepFViT path (Fig.\ref{image_Depo}(a)), tailored to capture localized spatial features, and the MaxViT path (Fig.\ref{image_Depo}(b)), suited for global dependency modeling across extended regions. Within RepFViT, the Spatio-Frequency Synergistic Modulation (SFSM) decomposes input frequency components, enabling high-frequency noise isolation and low-frequency structure preservation, thereby suppressing the effects of high-interference environments. The MaxViT path is configured for cross-scale global feature extraction, facilitating spatial association capture in complex scenes. In the feature fusion phase, a Dual-Stream Confluence (DSC) mechanism integrates multi-scale convolutional operations with a channel attention strategy, merging feature representations from both encoder paths. Subsequently, the Harmonized Subspace Spectro-Temporal Transformer (HastFormer) captures spatial correlations intrinsic to diverse terrain distributions. In the decoding stage, to mitigate the cumulative amplification of noise in layer-by-layer upsampling, Pluri-frequency Mamba (purfMamba) is introduced. Proposed purfMamba applies synergistic processing across the frequency and spatial domains, focusing on preserving coherence between global and local information at high resolution while maintaining noise control throughout the upsampling process.

## Installation
Initial learning rates are uniformly set at 0.0001, with batch sizes standardized to 2 across all models.  Experimental evaluations are conducted within a consistent hardware and software environment, featuring a workstation equipped with dual NVIDIA RTX 4080 Super GPUs, an AMD Ryzen R9-5950X processor, and 128GB RAM.  The experimental framework is structured in Python 3.9, employing PyTorch 2.0.0 and CUDA 11.8 for computational acceleration.

### Results
Table 1: The segmentation results of Depo-Net are compared with previous models on three SAR datasets (SARBuD, HRSID, FRBS), presented in three tables. The highest score for each metric is highlighted in red, while the second-best score is highlighted in blue. Segmentation models are detailed by method categories, with the best result within each category also highlighted in blue.

#### Visual segmentation results
A visual comparison of Depo-Net and other segmentation models is conducted across three SAR datasets. Five representative images are selected from each dataset for display. In these images, the segmentation results for target objects are filled in green, while the ground truth is outlined in red. Panel (a) represents the original image, {(b)-(g)} present the best segmentation results from each method category across the datasets, as shown in Table1. Specifically, (b) represents the best-performing model based on CNN methods across the three datasets, (c) represents the best-performing model based on CNN with attention mechanisms, and so on for the remaining categories, and (h) represents the segmentation result of Depo-Net.
